# Protractor Sample project for a very basic first test #
It uses jasmine as framework and jasmine-spec BDD reporter to replace the default "dot" reporter that comes with protractor.
Not much more, this is just a bare bones first test used to demo how to setup and start with protractor.

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and install the dependencies:
```
    npm install
```
2. In your terminal access the repo directory and type the following to start webdriver-manager:
```
    npm run serve
```
3. Open a second terminal and type the following to run the test.
```
    npm test
```

From this bare bones template you can start working your way up to an automated solution for your project, refer to [protractor's API documentation](http://www.protractortest.org/#/api) for details on methods and design patterns you can follow.

That's it,
enjoy.
